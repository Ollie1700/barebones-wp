# Barebones WP

## In a nutshell...

An absolute barebones WordPress theme template. No bullshit.

## About

Working with WordPress constantly, I grew tired of using the popular WordPress boilerplates due to the amount of bloat that is packaged with them. Everyone's projects are unique and as such there should be no predefined markup or way of doing things within any one project. Aside from trying your best to adhere to [WordPress' Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), your implementation and style should be unique to you. That's why Barebones WP provides you with the *bare minimum* required to implement a theme.

## Usage

* Clone this repo to your `wp-themes` directory
* _(Optional)_ Perform a **non case-sensitive, global** find & replace of the characters `wpbp` and replace with your project/theme name.
* Fill out the required fields in `style.css`
* Setup your workspace such that `scss` files in the `sass` folder are all compiled to `css/style.min.css` _**OR**_ shuffle the folders and setup the workspace however you'd like; just remember to enqueue any styles in `functions.php`.

Post-setup steps:
* Familiarise yourself with the [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/wp-hierarchy.png)
* Feel free to delete any templates you feel aren't relevant to your project. After all, this is meant to be barebones.
