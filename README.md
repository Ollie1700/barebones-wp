# Barebones WP

## What is this?

An absolute barebones WordPress theme template. No bullshit.

## Why?

Working with WordPress constantly, I grew tired of using the popular WordPress boilerplates such as [Underscores](https://underscores.me/) due to the amount of bloat that is packaged with them. For example, why do I need a million different HTML template implementations when I'm just looking to initialise the bare minimum for a WP theme?

## Usage

* Clone this repo to your `wp-themes` directory
* _(Optional)_ Perform a **non case-sensitive, global** find & replace of the characters `wpbp` and replace with your project/theme name.
* Fill out the required fields in `style.css`
* Setup your workspace such that `scss` files in the `sass` folder are all compiled to `css/style.min.css` _**OR**_ shuffle the folders and setup the workspace however you'd like; just remember to enqueue any styles in `functions.php`.

## Have a criticism and/or suggestion?

Awesome! I am by no means a WP expert so please feel free to fix/help me fix stuff. Simply submit an issue or a PR and I'll check it out.
