# Barebones WP

## "What is this?"

An absolute barebones WordPress theme template. No bullshit.

## "Why?"

Working with WordPress constantly, I grew tired of using the popular WordPress boilerplates such as [Underscores](https://underscores.me/) due to the amount of bloat that is packaged with them. For example, why do I need a million different HTML template implementations when I'm just looking to initialise the bare minimum for a WP theme?

## "I have a suggestion!"

Awesome! Simply submit an issue or a PR and I'll check it out.
